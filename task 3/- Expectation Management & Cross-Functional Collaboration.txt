1.What will be your approach to solving this issue? Explain your strategy and approach to
this?


Ans:- My approach to solving this issue would be to prioritize Task 2 as it has a shorter deadline and is for a priority customer. I would reach out to the low-priority customer for Task 1 and inform them about my unavailability due to the family emergency and ask for a revised due date if possible. If a revised due date cannot be agreed upon, I would still work on Task 1 but allocate more resources to Task 2 to ensure it is completed on time. I would also communicate regularly with both customers to keep them updated on the progress of their respective tasks and address any concerns they may have. Additionally, I would make arrangements to have a backup plan in place in case the family emergency prolongs and affects my work further.


2.How will you inform the 2 separate account managers of both customers about your
approach? Write an internal message informing Manoj (Account manager for Task 1) &
Ravi (Account Manager for Task 2) about your respective approach.


Ans:-
Subject: Update on Tasks 1 and 2 Due to Family Emergency

Dear Manoj and Ravi,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to inform you both that I am facing a family emergency that requires my immediate attention and will affect my work for at least the next 3 days.

Given the circumstances, I have taken the following approach to manage Task 1 and Task 2:

Task 2 (Priority Customer) has a campaign that needs to go live in the next 2 days, so I have prioritized this task and will allocate additional resources to ensure it is completed on time.

For Task 1 (Low-Priority Customer), I have reached out to the customer and informed them about my unavailability due to the family emergency and asked for a revised due date if possible. If a revised due date cannot be agreed upon, I will still work on Task 1 but allocate more resources to Task 2 to ensure it is completed on time.

I will keep you both updated on the progress of the tasks and address any concerns that may arise. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,

Swapneswar Nayak


3.How will you communicate the delay of additional 3 days to the customer? (Write an
email to the customer informing them about this).


Ans:- 
Subject: Update on Task  - Delay Due to Family Emergency

Dear Manoj and Ravi,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you regarding the progress of Task that we are working on for your account. I am facing a family emergency that requires my immediate attention and will affect my work for at least the next 3 days.

As a result of this unexpected situation, I regret to inform you that there will be a delay in the completion of Task . I understand the importance of meeting the original due date, but I wanted to be transparent about the situation and its impact on our timeline.

I have made arrangements to allocate additional resources to this task, and I will work diligently to minimize the delay as much as possible. I will keep you updated on the progress and work with you to establish a revised due date that works for both of us.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and I appreciate your understanding and support. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

Best regards,

Swapneswar Nayak
